A fully responsive starter theme for designers and developers.

== Description ==

A fully responsive, SEO-friendly, jQuery-ready, and WordPress theme review guidelines compliant starter theme for designers and developers, which comes with its own built-in CSS grid (https://generic.tools/grid/). This generic/starter/clean/simple/bare/blank/minimalist/example/cheatsheet/white-label/HTML5/CSS3/base/foundation/framework/skeleton/boilerplate/whatever theme was created specifically as a tool to assist with building client sites virtually from scratch or building and submitting your own themes. It's updated to reflect new changes in theme review requirements, to make the process much easier with a higher level of success (some theme authors never make it through), but please post bugs, suggestions for improvement, or support requests on GitHub (https://github.com/bhadaway/generic-theme/issues) if you're getting jammed up on your review ticket. Note: the aim of the project is to meet WordPress guideline requirements, but not necessarily all of its recommendations. The biggest diversion would be the semi-minification of Generic's code. If you prefer the WordPress official coding standard (https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/) or some other popular standard, you may download a free trial of PhpStorm (https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) or use some other code formatter/beautifier to automatically and instantly bulk format all the code to your liking. If I was able to help you out, consider making a donation (https://calmestghost.com/donate). Thank you and enjoy!

Hack this theme up however you like starting with making it your own:

Open in your favorite editor and Find and Replace "generic" with your own theme slug.

Enjoy!
